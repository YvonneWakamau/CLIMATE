This is a simple climate application that can track the climate condition of any city in the world. with parameters such as temperature, humidty, pressure and wind. This project was carried out by Yvonne Kamau currently doing my project at ALX africa Software Engineering School This project helps travelers know the condition/climate forecast of any particular city/region of the world. I worked alone on this project. As an engineer, i wanted to focus on 2 things: creating an experience that would be both web and mobile-friendly, and also sourcing a reliable API. for my API's, I used https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=0CAQQw7AJahcKEwi4v6Prl-j7AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usgs.gov%2Ffaqs%2Fwhat-difference-between-weather-and-climate-change&psig=AOvVaw1XVNgk2djqgjCfOpV6mteq&ust=1670525836286329 to get global city, region, and country data. and https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CAQQw7AJahcKEwig9IbDmOj7AhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncei.noaa.gov%2Fproducts%2Fland-based-station%2Fglobal-historical-climatology-network-daily&psig=AOvVaw3HZ_V1iRJmZ4fkK_3h3YF4&ust=1670526020658082 to get historical climate data available for any coordinate. I enjoy travelling especially by road, so it was an easy project focus to agree upon.Due to lack of technology to forecast the diferent climatic conditions. 

TECHNOLOGY AND ARCHITECTURE It collects environmental data from the device's sensors and offers real-time, hyper-local climate info. It aims to build a social community where people can post current conditions and interact with each other. I used React as my front-end frame work, used CSS and JavaScript in my project as well. I also installed React-icon dependency which was of help for generating the climate icons for the task completion. created React components which are description.jsx , app.js, index.js and climate service components respectively. I used a dynamic background which updates it self when the temperature is <=16 degrees and > 16 degrees
